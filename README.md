# timescalecalculus
`timescalecalculus` is a package for doing [calculus on time scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-scale_calculus)

## Usage
Place the `timescalecalculus.py` file into the folder with your current working script and import the package using

    import timescalecalculus as tsc 

Time scales are objects in this package, and each time scale object comes with methods for the forward jump, graininess, delta derivative, delta integral, and so on. Methods to solve systems of dynamic equations on time scales are included.

## Documentation
Currently, the documentation is **severely** out of date due to rapid development of the package over Summer 2019. Documentation will always be at [this page](http://timescalewiki.org/index.php/Timescalecalculus_python_library_documentation).

In the meantime, please feel free to e-mail Tom Cuchta (```tomcuchta@gmail.com```) for assistance in using the package.
