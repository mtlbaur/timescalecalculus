#Timescalecalculus
timescalecalculus is a package for doing [calculus on time scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-scale_calculus)

##Usage
Place the timescalecalculus.py file into the folder with your current working script and import the package using
```python
import timescalecalculus as tsc```

Time scales are objects in this package, and each time scale object comes with methods for the forward jump, graininess, delta derivative, delta integral, and so on. Methods to solve dynamic equations on time scales are included.

##Documentation
Currently, the documentation is **severely** out of date due to rapid development of the package over summer 2019. Documentation will always be at [this page](http://timescalewiki.org/index.php/Timescalecalculus_python_library_documentation).

In the meantime, please feel free to e-mail Tom Cuchta (```tomcuchta@gmail.com```) for assistance in using the package.

##Contributing
Pull requests are welcome! Please feel free to contribute to this code.
